# ridge: Ridge Regression with automatic selection of the penalty parameter

###About
The ridge package offers linear and logistic ridge regression, especially for small 
data sets and genome-wide SNP data.

### Support
If you found a bug or have suggestions, feel free to get in contact via 
steffen.moritz10 at gmail.com

Since I only have taken over this package (it was orphaned) - 
it might be that I can't help with all details. 

Be aware, that therefore I also can not guarantee 
to 100% that everything works as expected.
